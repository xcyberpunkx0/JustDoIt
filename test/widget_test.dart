// This is a basic Flutter widget test.
//
// To perform an interaction with a widget in your test, use the WidgetTester
// utility that Flutter provides. For example, you can send tap and scroll
// gestures. You can also use WidgetTester to find child widgets in the widget
// tree, read text, and verify that the values of widget properties are correct.

// This serves as a fundamental Flutter widget test. 
// To engage with a widget during your testing, make use of the WidgetTester tool supplied by Flutter. 
// This tool allows you to carry out actions like tapping and scrolling, as well as locating child widgets
// within the widget hierarchy, reading text, and confirming the accuracy of widget property values.
